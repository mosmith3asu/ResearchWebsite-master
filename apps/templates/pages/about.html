                        Mason is a student-researcher at Arizona State University interested in facilitating intelligent
                        robotics such that they can intuitively interact with humans and assist us in everyday life.
                        To accomplish this, Mason has chosen to focus on advancing cognition-aware robotic systems may
                        better understand why and how humans make the decisions they do. Doing this, Mason hopes to improve
                        the relationship between and efficiency when human and robots collaborate. Mason is currently pursuing a PhD in Systems Engineering but has obtained degrees in
                        BSE Engineering (Robotics), BS Human Systems Engineering, and a MS Engineering
