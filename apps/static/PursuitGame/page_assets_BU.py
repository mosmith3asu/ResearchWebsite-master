TEXT['consent'] = "I am a graduate student under the direction of Professor Wenlong Zhang in the Ira Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University.  I am conducting a research study to investigate human interaction and decision-making under risky situations. <br><br>" \
"Your participation will involve playing a series of seven games with a virtual partner taking an estimated total of 15 minutes for the whole experiment. The game will be played in a web interface and will require both a mouse and computer to play. You have the right not to answer any question, and to stop participation at any time.<br><br>" \
"Your participation in this study is voluntary.  If you choose not to participate or to withdraw from the study at any time, there will be no penalty. You must be 18 or older, able to operate a computer, and meet the required demographic group inquired before the experiment begins to participate in this study.<br><br>" \
"Your participation will benefit research in human decision-making for the purpose of improving control models for robots that interact with humans in dynamic ways. Specifically, your responses to surveys will help investigate how human trust in virtual agents developed under different models of behavior. Also, the actions you take during the game will help validate and improve robotic understanding of humans. After the experiment is complete, further explanation about how the virtual partner modeled your actions is available if you wish to learn more about how you are contributing to this field. There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to your participation.<br><br>" \
"Responses to all survey questions, participation date, and the actions you take during the game will be collected. To protect your privacy, all personal identifiers will be removed from your data and stored on a secure server. Your data will be confidential and the de-identified data collected as a part of this study will not be shared with others outside of the research team approved by this studyâ€™s IRB or be used for future research purposes or other uses. The results of this study may be used in reports, presentations, or publications but your name will not be used. <br><br>" \
"If you have any questions concerning the research study, please contact the research team at: mosmith3@asu.edu or wenlong.zhang@asu.edu. If you have any questions about your rights as a subject/participant in this research, or if you feel you have been placed at risk, you can contact the Chair of the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board, through the ASU Office of Research Integrity and Assurance, at (480) 965-6788.
